# Code-Quizz
*Building a timed coding quiz!*

This week is an *even numbered* which means as the student, I have to code everything from scratch.

Files

HTML: 
index.html; This file contains the basic html code that is sort of the black on white (simple) text about wht is contained in the webpage. Lines 5 and 22 are important for the purpose of this challenge as they link the index.html to the CSS and JavaScript files.

CSS:
style.css; This file (labeled as Line 5 in the index.html) contains all the styling of the webpage. This is where the look and feel of the webpage is.

JavaScript:
script.js; This file is where we (my left and right brain) make the webpage responsive and user friendly.
